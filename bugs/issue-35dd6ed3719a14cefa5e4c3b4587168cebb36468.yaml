title: Field with user image and name can grow too big
desc: |-
  The field with the user image and name is too wide. If the arrow pointing
  at the user image is at the top, the name could be so wide that it goes
  below the arrow, touching the message box. This would mean the user column
  can be so small that it's as wide as it is high.
